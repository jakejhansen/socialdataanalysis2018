    "    \n",
    "* Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.\n",
    "* Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. (I'm going to skip saying \"in your own words\" going forward, but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).\n",
    "* The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?\n",
    "* I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes \"[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs\". What does he mean by that?\n",
    "* What is a *Quantile plot*? What is it good for. \n",
    "* How is a *Probablity plot* defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?\n",
    "* One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better. \n",
    "* I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?\n",
    "* The book doesn't mention [violin plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot). Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?"

    "* Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes \"the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise in the data is small\". What do you think his argument is?\n",
    "* Can you think of a real-world example of a multivariate relationship like the one in Fig 3-3 (lower right panel)?\n",
    "* What are the two methods Janert metions for smoothing noisy data? Can you think of other ones?\n",
    "* What are residuals? Why is it a good idea to plot the residuals of your fit?\n",
    "* Explain in your own words the point of the smooth tube in figure 3-7.\n",
    "* What kind of relationships will a semi-log plot help you discover?\n",
    "* What kind of functions will loglog plots help you see?\n",
    "* What the h#ll is *banking* and what element from our visual system does it use to help us see patterns? What are potential problems with banking?\n",
    "* I think figure 3-14 makes an important point about linear fits that is rarely made. What is it? \n",

    "* Set up the plot so you can toggle between *only women*, *only men*, *all data*, using our skills from last time.\n",
